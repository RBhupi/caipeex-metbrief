This is read me that may or may not help you at this time. But suggestions are welcome.
0. Login to your network first for internet.

1. delete ./fig Folder or move it to ./past_figs/

2. run sh ./wget_images.sh

3. Keep watching the terminal while downloading images, to know any unavailable images. If suspect missing images, scroll up and down to check for downloading logs.

4. If pdflatex stops at some point check for which missing image it is stopping for and press enter to skip it for time being.

5. Now download following figures manualy in .png/pdf format and crop (screenshots only) to appropriate size.
    *the figures should have same path and file names as follow.
    ./manual_fig/backward.pdf    #backward trajectory. Do not crop; save as pdf
    ./manual_fig/forward.pdf    #forward trajectory. Do not crop; save as pdf
    ./manual_fig/radar24.png    #24hr radar accumulation from IMD in png; crop
    ./manual_fig/radarppi.png    # radar ppi from IMD
    ./manual_fig/rapid.png        #rapid figure for mid-level moisture; png

    5.1 To download Rapid go to rapid.imd.gov.in
        -select INSAT 3D sounder
        -product geophysical
        -L2, Precipitable water

6. run pdflatex metbrief.tex and check that all the figures are present. If latex stops for any figure press enter to skip that figure.

7. Go to the text folder to write your analysis in the following sections
    ./text/IMD_summary.tex
    ./text/outlook.tex
Only replace the text one line at a time. Do not paste whole sections at once.

degrees=$^\circ$  for example 26 $^\circ$C

Do not write following symbols or similar in your text:
#     $     %     &     \     ^     _     ~
